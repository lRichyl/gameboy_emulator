# Gameboy Emulator
A cycle-accurate Game Boy emulator written in C++, featuring CPU emulation, graphics rendering, input handling, and audio support. This project was built to deepen my understanding of low-level programming, hardware emulation, and system architecture.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ CPU Emulation – Implements the Sharp LR35902 (Z80-like) processor with accurate instruction timing.
- ✅ PPU (Graphics) Emulation – Supports tile-based rendering, background scrolling, and sprite handling.
- ✅ Input Handling – Maps Game Boy button inputs to keyboard controls.
- ✅ Sound Emulation (WIP) – Working on implementing the Game Boy's APU (Audio Processing Unit).
- ✅ Game Compatibility – Runs various commercial ROMs.
